            I ran Y2KORE, a Y2K clothing dropshipping site, for a year, gaining hands-on experience in e-commerce, digital marketing, customer service, and website management. Profiting from the business taught me how to effectively manage and grow an online store from the ground up.

          Y2KORE was a Y2K-inspired online clothing brand that captured the distinctive style of the early 2000s. Within one year, Y2KORE gained over 1,000 followers on Instagram and achieved 200+ sales. Running the brand provided me with hands-on experience in e-commerce, digital marketing, customer service, and website management, building a strong foundation in online retail and brand development. <br><br>Ultimately, I chose not to continue with Y2KORE, opting to explore new opportunities and more sustainable business models for future growth.

              <p>
                Running my personal online dropshipping business taught me valuable skills related to business strategy, as well as the technical aspects of e-commerce. I built and managed the store using Shopify, which provided me the ability to create a professional and user-friendly online storefront quickly without having to develop everything from scratch. This gave me the opportunity to focus more on the strategic areas like identifying needs for customers, market trends, and competitor analysis. Utilizing Shopify's built-in analytics, it came to my notice about customer behaviors, locations, and purchase patterns, which helped me in refining my marketing efforts to better retain customers.
<br><br>
Leveraging Shopify's built-in tools for SEO, integrating social media, and running email campaigns taught me hands-on digital marketing. I learned how to optimize the customer journey, increase conversions, and drive more repeat business. In general, this experience gave me a solid understanding of how e-commerce platforms work, the importance of data-driven decisions, and how to engage and retain customers effectively-skills that I can bring to a web development or marketing role.

        <h2>Identifying a Market Gap</h2>
        <p>
          I identified a significant gap in the market for Y2K clothing, as there were few places to find authentic pieces. Recognizing this opportunity, I stepped in and quickly built a collection of over 200 products. As a result, sales began to grow steadily, and I gained significant traction in a competitive market.

        This project highlights my full-stack approach to design and engineering, from building the physical table to designing the electronics and developing a web-based control interface. By combining custom-built hardware with a responsive web server, I created an interactive LED experience that demonstrates my skills in both physical construction and software integration, bridging hands-on craftsmanship with seamless, user-friendly technology.
